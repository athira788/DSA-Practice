Problem : Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Solution: We will be iterate through hashset (for faster access) of the list. Once we get the leftmost element of teh sequence, we will get the length of teh sequence & check if it is the longest till now.

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hashSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        for i in hashSet : 
          if(i-1 not in hashSet):
            length = 0
            while(i + length in hashSet):
              length += 1
          longest = max(longest,length)
        return longest
