Problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Solution: Time - O(n) & Space - O(1)
def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        count1= 1
        count2 = 2
        for i in range(3,n+1):
            count1,count2 = count2 , count2+count1
        return count2
